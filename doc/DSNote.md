# Week4 
The class this week was cancelled due to National Day.

# Week5
[Week5](DSWeek5.pdf)
In this week, basic properties of dynamics on Lie groups and their homogeneous spaces are introduced, concepts like stable and unstable subgroup and submanifold is introduced under the setting of homogeneous dynamics. Finally, notion of strong mixing is introduced in the language of unitary representation. In this note, we consider the proof of vanishing theorem of matrix coefficients due to Howe and Moore.

# Week6
[Week6](DSWeek6.pdf)
In this week, we learned the proof of Howe-Moore vanishing theorem for matrix coefficients of unitary representations of SL(n, R). As a appli-
cation, this note presents how this is applied to the problem of counting lattice points in hyperbolic plane.

# Week 8 and 9
[Week8,9](DSWeek89.pdf)
In this two weeks, we classified all periodic A-orbits, and showed that they all come from totally real fields.

# Week 10
[Week10](DSWeek10.pdf)
In week 10, the relationship between dynamics and quadratic forms, products of linear forms is introduced.

# Week 11
[Week11](DSWeek11.pdf)
In week 11, we proved a theorem relating the periodic orbit and values of products of linear forms at integer points.
